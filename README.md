Program used to help manage paychecks.

Users will be able to enter how much they would like to sort and the program will display the following:

1. Amount to go to each section
  (Rough example below showing what a layout would look like)
  
  amount entered: X

  Play money (10%):
  Groceries (15%):
  Gas money (20%):
  Savings (20%): 
  Misc. (10%):
  Bills (25%):  
  
2. Total for each section

  Play money: 2000
  Groceries: 1000
  Gas money: 500
  Savings: 250
  Misc.: 200
